## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


## Including Plots

```{r}
library(rgdal)
setwd("C:/Users/rvais/Wdirectory/SPA")
dir(getwd())
streets <- readOGR(dsn= getwd(), layer = "pgh_streets")
plot(streets)

# Number of road segments
length(streets)
# Min, max, and mean segment lengths (in miles)
min(streets$LENGTH)
max(streets$LENGTH)
mean(streets$LENGTH)
# Filter out segments below mean length and create map showing remaining segments
greater_mean=streets[streets$LENGTH>=mean(streets$LENGTH),]
greater_mean
plot(greater_mean)
```


```{r}

load("C:/Users/rvais/Wdirectory/SPA/lnd.RData")
load("C:/Users/rvais/Wdirectory/SPA/stations.RData")

plot(lnd)
points(stations)
plot(stations,col="red",add=TRUE)

# Mean in each polygon
st1<-stations[c('Value')]
st_X=stations[c('coords.x1')]
st_Y=stations[c('coords.x2')]
Xaggr=aggregate(st_X, lnd, mean)
Yaggr=aggregate(st_Y, lnd, mean)
aggr=aggregate(st1,lnd, mean)
data=data.frame(aggr, Xaggr, Yaggr)

# Plot aggregated values
### Regions with below average values are red; regions with above values are green.
spplot(aggr)
plot(aggr, col=ifelse(aggr$Value<mean(aggr$Value),'blue','pink'))

# Plot before regression to display effect of aggregation
#Plotting co-ordinate x1 against value before and after aggregation
plot(x=stations$coords.x1, y=stations$Value,col='red')
plot(x=data$coords.x1, y=data$Value,col='blue')
#Plotting co-ordinate x2 against value before and after aggregation
plot(x=stations$coords.x2, y=stations$Value,col='green')
plot(x=data$coords.x2, y=data$Value,col='pink')

# Regressions before and after aggregation;After applying lm the,effect is stronger after aggregation.
#Regression before applying aggregation functions for co-ordinate x1
summary(lm(data=stations, Value~coords.x1))
#Regression after applying aggregation functions for co-ordinate x1
summary(lm(data=data, Value~coords.x1))

#Regression before applying aggregation functions for co-ordinate x2
summary(lm(data=stations, Value~coords.x2))
#Regression after applying aggregation functions for co-ordinate x2
summary(lm(data=data, Value~coords.x2))
```

By applying regression on the data,we conclude that after applying regression the,effect is stronger after aggregation.
The R sqaured stats also helps us to conclude that effect is increasing in the aggregated model.
